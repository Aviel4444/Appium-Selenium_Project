Hello everyone, as a software tester who deals with automation, I prepared a project combining Appium code and Selenium code.
The project is based on a real website and its application on an emulator phone, I performed various tests that check comparisons between the details displayed on the website and the details in the emulator and of course also tests that perform various actions on the browser using Selenium and on the emulator using Appium.
I hope you like the project and let me know if there are things to upgrade and add.
